# DAFX
 C++ implementation of Matlabscripts from the book DAFX: Digital Audio Effects by Udo ZÃ¶lzer. \
 I use [JUCE](https://juce.com/get-juce/) to debug VST3 plugins inside hosts. \
 I did this for study purposes. 
 
## Chapter 2
 - Code \
 Basic Allpassfilters \
 LFOs (Basic Waveforms) \
 Gain smoothing \
 FIR/IIR Comb Filters \
 Interpolation
 - FX \
 WahWahEffect \
 Phasing \
 Vibrato \
 MultiBandEffect

## Not Working
- Phasing isn't very audible, only with white noise, maybe a higher order notch filter will do
